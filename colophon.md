This is my [colophon page](https://indieweb.org/colophon).

My website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a template theme designed by me, which is deployed and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This website **does not** track users.

Some other bits of tech used by this site are:
- [instant.page](https://instant.page/) - this helps to speed up navigation by preloading pages on hover making the experience feel instant
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - the toolkit used for the various icons found across the site
- [Droid Sans](https://online-fonts.com/fonts/droid-sans) - the font used across the entire website

If you want to see how this website works, everything can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/AnthonyVadala/AnthonyVadala.github.io).
